          <h3 class="title-page">Gap Inc: A Career Nightmare</h3>
          <p class="text-paragraph">
            The grass wasn't always greener on the otherside, but it did have its benefits. Working full-time now in search of a career
            path was the hardest thing. I had no 4 year degree, I had no real experience, and the worst thing was that Covid had just came 
            around. The overtime was maxed, and the days were physical exhausting. Everyday waking up at 3:50am and leaving at 3pm was 
            a routine I'd never forget. My step counts were probably 20k a day, but hey, at least I got some exercise while being there.
            <br>
            Working at the GAP Inc warehouse was great not having to interact with customers, but the work demand felt over the top. As 
            a merchandise handler (picker), x amount of items per hour were the standard to hit, and if the numbers were not met, 
            disciplinary actions would occur. After excelling as a picker, then came the more technical stuff. I was moved up to a 
            exceptionist who's primary job was to fix the problems sent by the picker. This required a lot of reading data and cleaning 
            house by organizing the warehouse inventory. Many items would be missing and many items would be damaged, it was an exceptionist
            duty to fix the problem. 
            <br>
            I knew I couldn't stay here as I begain to get comfortable. Days became dull and Covid made things worse. However I decided to
            take advantage of Covid-19 and began my search for a career opportunity. During my breaks, lunch, and time off to myself, I 
            was constantly applying. Denial after denial for a whole year my self confidence was shattered. I felt like this was all I could offer to the 
            world. I knew that my experience and level of education were overlooked, so I did my research 
            and found a great opportunity with The County of Fresno that opened my very first real door. After meeting minimum requirement, I was given the chance
            to test as an office assistant. Surely enough I scored well and was given the interview for a life change.
