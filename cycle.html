          <p class="text-paragraph">
            When the gym had shut down due to Covid-19, my passion and goal did not stop. Fitness was
            the only thing I had that made me feel proud of myself. I wanted to keep going; I did not
            want to lose the one thing that kept me at peace. I found myself a mess during Covid-19 
            as I was stuck with my own thoughts. However I was introduced to a new fitness hobby that
            sparked a new interesting by a great friend.
            <br>
            Cycling came into my life and it gave me a new learning curve. My passion was fired up as 
            all I could think about were road bikes and the weekend to hit the road. After months of riding,
            I finally purchased my very own road bike. It took over 2 months to find the perfect bike that
            met the desired specs and price point. When the bike came in, modifying it was on my mind every
            second. It was the best thing that came out of Covid-19 and I was able to still continue my 
            weight loss journey.
            <br>
            I've seen many parts of Fresno and Clovis. It was amazing to see how far the bike could take us. 
            I've rode to Woodward Park, Millerton Lake, Avacado Lake, and even to the Humphreys Station! My 
            favorite trip had to be Sacramento State to Folsom Lake. It was a crazy 50 mile bike ride that 
            probably won't ever happen again, but it was one heck of an accomplishment. I finally hit
            the 180 pound club.
            <br>
            Cycling during Covid-19 was amazing, and with that, I started to seek other fun activities 
            and realized time was the most precious thing.
